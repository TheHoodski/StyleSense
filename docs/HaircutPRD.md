# Product Requirements Document: StyleSense AI

## Overview
StyleSense AI is an intelligent web application that democratizes access to professional styling advice by using AI to analyze users' face and head shapes and provide tailored haircut recommendations. The platform brings celebrity-level styling expertise to everyday users through advanced computer vision technology.

## Problem Statement
Most people lack access to high-quality styling advice that considers their unique facial features.
