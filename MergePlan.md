## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | Week 1 | Project structure, build configuration |
| Phase 2 | Weeks 2-4 | Frontend UI components, pages, state management |
| Phase 3 | Weeks 3-5 | Backend API, database, analysis service |
| Phase 4 | Weeks 6-7 | Integration testing, user flow validation |
| Phase 5 | Week 8 | Deployment, optimization, monitoring |

## Key Integration Decisions

1. **UI Framework**: Use shape-your-style-guide's UI system while preserving StyleSense AI's functionality
2. **Face Detection**: Implement client-side detection with server-side fallback
3. **State Management**: Use React Context instead of Redux for simpler state management
4. **Authentication**: Keep JWT authentication from StyleSense AI but with improved UI
5. **API Services**: Maintain StyleSense AI's comprehensive API structure
6. **Database**: Keep the full database model structure from StyleSense AI
7. **Subscriptions**: Maintain the premium features model but with better UI presentation
